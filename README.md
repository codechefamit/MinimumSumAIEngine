# MinimumSumAIEngine
Developed a framework for the Minimum Sum game for the ability to code bots who play the game.
A LAN based cards game in which bots have to get the minimum sum and then Show the cards to other players. Rules of game are simple bot get 5 cards at the starting of the game and the bot could replace one card and pick one card from either the deck or the Discard pile. Bot can also replace more than one card if they possess the same value. Show can be requested by a user on his turn. A show by a user leads to Game Engine calculating all the sums and telling the totals. If the bot who requests a show does'nt have the minimum sum then he gets a 50 point penalty for each user who has sum lower than him. A player is eliminated if his total reaches over 200. The winner of a round is awarded 0 points.
